                                                        Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk
                                                        proudly through a world that greets them with fearful
                                                        incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves,
                                                        dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race,
                                                        combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some
                                                        dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the
                                                        ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves
                                                        adrift, with no clear calling in life.

                                    aria-labelledby="dragonbornStuff-tab">
                                    <p class="card-text scroll p-2" style="max-height: 30rem;">
                                        <br>Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form,
                                        though
                                        they
                                        lack wings or a tail.<br>

                                        <br>The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors
                                        of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more
                                        uniform
                                        appearance.<br>

                                        <br>Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes
                                        ranging
                                        to
                                        scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green.<br>

                                        <br>They are tall and strongly built, often standing close
                                        to 6½ feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more.<br>

                                        <br>Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a
                                        thumb
                                        on each hand.<br>

                                        <br>The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some
                                        dragonborn
                                        clans.<br>

                                        <br>These dragonborn often boast scales that more closely match those of their
                                        dragon
                                        ancestor—bright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic
                                        gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze.<br>
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="tab-pane" id="dragonbornMoreStuff" role="tabpanel"
                                    aria-labelledby="dragonbornMoreStuff-tab">
                                    <p class="card-text scroll p-2" style="max-height: 30rem;">
                                        <br>To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself.<br>

                                        <br>Dragonborn owe their
                                        devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods.<br>

                                        <br>Each dragonborn’s
                                        conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the
                                        clan
                                        can
                                        result in expulsion and exile.<br>

                                        <br>Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the
                                        clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.<br>

                                        <br>A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency of the
                                        race
                                        as
                                        a whole. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors.<br>

                                        <br>They hate to fail, and they
                                        push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something.<br>

                                        <br>A dragonborn holds
                                        mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal.<br>

                                        <br>Members of other races who share the same
                                        commitment find it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn.<br>

                                        <br>Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, they recognize that help
                                        is
                                        sometimes needed in difficult situations.<br>

                                        <br>But the best source for such help is the clan, and
                                        when a clan needs help, it turns to another dragonborn clan before seeking aid
                                        from
                                        other
                                        races—or even from the gods.<br>

                                        <br>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers
                                        of stone and metal.<br>

                                        <br>Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and
                                        compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet
                                        taller.<br>

                                        <br>Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger
                                        folk.<br>

                                        <br>Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the
                                        most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth.<br>

                                        <br>Their hair,
                                        worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler
                                        dwarves often have red hair.<br>

                                        <br>Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them
                                        carefully.<br>
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                    <p class="card-text scroll p-2" style="max-height: 30rem;">
                                        <br>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves
                                        often
                                        remember a very different world.<br>

                                        <br>For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in
                                        Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more
                                        than
                                        three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an
                                        exile
                                        that lasted over 250 years.<br>

                                        <br>This longevity grants them a perspective on the world
                                        that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.<br>

                                        <br>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the
                                        passage
                                        of centuries with stoic endurance and little change.<br>

                                        <br>They respect the traditions of
                                        their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient
                                        strongholds in the youth of the world, and don’t abandon those traditions
                                        lightly.<br>

                                        <br>Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold
                                        the
                                        dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the
                                        forge.<br>

                                        <br>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive
                                        in
                                        action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness.<br>

                                        <br>Many dwarves have a strong sense of
                                        justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered.<br>

                                        <br>A wrong done to one
                                        dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf’s
                                        hunt
                                        for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.<br>

                                                        ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where

                                                        Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good

                                        <br>With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly
                                        beautiful
                                        to
                                        humans and members of many other races.<br>

                                        <br>They are slightly shorter than humans on
                                        average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet.<br>

                                        <br>They are more
                                        slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds.<br>

                                        <br>Males and females are about
                                        the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.<br>

                                        <br>Elves’ coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin
                                        in
                                        shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and
                                        eyes
                                        like pools of liquid gold or silver.<br>

                                        <br>Elves have no facial and little body hair.<br>

                                        <br>They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet
                                        lovely
                                        jewelry.<br>

                                        <br>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on
                                        events
                                        that
                                        might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply.<br>

                                        <br>They are more often amused than
                                        excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy.<br>

                                        <br>They tend to remain aloof and
                                        unfazed by petty happenstance.<br>

                                        <br>When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on
                                        a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and
                                        relentless.<br>

                                        <br>They
                                        are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them.<br>

                                        <br>They reply to
                                        petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.<br>

                                        <br>Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of
                                        danger.<br>

                                        <br>They
                                        trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to
                                        violence.<br>

                                        <br>They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes,
                                        confident that they can simply wait the invaders out.<br>

                                        <br>But when the need arises,
                                        elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and
                                        strategy.<br>

                                        <br>A gnome’s energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch of his
                                        or
                                        her
                                        tiny body.<br>

                                        <br>Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds.<br>

                                        <br>Their
                                        tan or brown faces are usually adorned with broad smiles (beneath their
                                        prodigious
                                        noses), and their bright eyes shine with excitement.<br>

                                        <br>Their fair hair has a tendency
                                        to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the gnome’s insatiable
                                        interest in
                                        everything around.<br>

                                        <br>A gnome’s personality is writ large in his or her appearance.<br>

                                        <br>A male gnome’s beard,
                                        in contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often styled into
                                        curious forks or neat points.<br>

                                        <br>A gnome’s clothing, though usually made in modest
                                        earth tones, is elaborately decorated with embroidery, embossing, or gleaming
                                        jewels.<br>
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                    aria-labelledby="gnomeMoreStuff-tab">
                                    <p class="card-text scroll p-2" style="max-height: 30rem;">
                                        <br>As far as gnomes are concerned, being alive is a wonderful thing, and they
                                        squeeze
                                        every ounce of enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life.<br>

                                        <br>Humans might
                                        wonder about getting bored over the course of such a long life, and elves take
                                        plenty of time to savor the beauties of the world in their long years, but
                                        gnomes
                                        seem to worry that even with all that time, they can’t get in enough of the
                                        things
                                        they want to do and see.<br>

                                        <br>Gnomes speak as if they can’t get the thoughts out of their heads fast
                                        enough.<br>

                                        <br>Even
                                        as they offer ideas and opinions on a range of subjects, they still manage to
                                        listen
                                        carefully to others, adding the appropriate exclamations of surprise and
                                        appreciation along the way.<br>

                                        <br>Though gnomes love jokes of all kinds, particularly puns and pranks, they’re
                                        just as
                                        dedicated to the more serious tasks they undertake.<br>

                                        <br>Many gnomes are skilled
                                        engineers, alchemists, tinkers, and inventors.<br>

                                        <br>They’re willing to make mistakes and
                                        laugh at themselves in the process of perfecting what they do, taking bold
                                        (sometimes foolhardy) risks and dreaming large.<br>

                                                        their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones
                                                        age while time barely touches them. Others live with the elves, growing restless as
                                                        they reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while their peers
                                                        continue to live as children. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose
                                                        lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the
                                                        adventuring life.

                                        <br>To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, they look human.<br>

                                        <br>In height,
                                        they’re on par with both parents, though they’re neither as slender as elves nor
                                        as
                                        broad as humans.<br>

                                        <br>They range from under 5 feet to about 6 feet tall, and from 100 to
                                        180 pounds, with men only slightly taller and heavier than women.<br>

                                        <br>Half-elf men do
                                        have facial hair, and sometimes grow beards to mask their elven ancestry.<br>

                                        <br>Half-elven
                                        coloration and features lie somewhere between their human and elf parents, and
                                        thus
                                        show a variety even more pronounced than that found among either race.<br>

                                        <br>They tend to have the eyes of their elven parents.<br>

                                        <br>Half-elves have no lands of their own, though they are welcome in human
                                        cities
                                        and
                                        somewhat less welcome in elven forests.<br>

                                        <br>In large cities in regions where elves and
                                        humans interact often, half-elves are sometimes numerous enough to form small
                                        communities of their own.<br>

                                        <br>They enjoy the company of other half-elves, the only
                                        people who truly understand what it is to live between these two worlds.<br>

                                        <br>In most parts of the world, though, half-elves are uncommon enough that one
                                        might
                                        live for years without meeting another.<br>

                                        <br>Some half-elves prefer to avoid company
                                        altogether, wandering the wilds as trappers, foresters, hunters, or adventurers
                                        and
                                        visiting civilization only rarely.<br>

                                        <br>Like elves, they are driven by the wanderlust
                                        that comes of their longevity.<br>

                                        <br>Others, in contrast, throw themselves into the thick
                                        of society, putting their charisma and social skills to great use in diplomatic
                                        roles or as swindlers.<br>

                                                        settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a
                                                        blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation.
                                                        Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others
                                                        form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide
                                                        horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples.
                                                        But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon
                                                        jostling along a dirt road or a raft floating downriver.

                                        <br>The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by
                                        avoiding
                                        notice or, barring that, avoiding offense.<br>

                                        <br>Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear
                                        relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow
                                        of
                                        empires and on the edges of wars and political strife.<br>

                                        <br>They are inclined to be
                                        stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds.<br>

                                        <br>Halflings’ skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is
                                        usually
                                        brown or sandy brown and wavy.<br>

                                        <br>They have brown or hazel eyes.<br>

                                        <br>Halfling men often
                                        sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches even more
                                        so.<br>

                                        <br>They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring
                                        bright
                                        colors.<br>

                                        <br>Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing.<br>

                                        <br>They’re concerned with basic
                                        needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation.<br>

                                        <br>Even the wealthiest
                                        of halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather than on display for
                                        all
                                        to see.<br>

                                        <br>They have a knack for finding the most straightforward solution to a
                                        problem, and have little patience for dithering.<br>

                                        <br>Halflings are an affable and cheerful people.<br>

                                        <br>They cherish the bonds of family and
                                        friendship as well as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of

                                        or glory.<br>

                                        <br>Even adventurers among them usually venture into the world for reasons of
                                        community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity.<br>

                                        <br>They love discovering new things,
                                        even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of
                                        clothing.<br>

                                        <br>Halflings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any living thing
                                        suffer.<br>

                                        <br>They are generous, happily sharing what they have even in lean times.<br>

                                                        Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood
                                                        giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals.

                                        <br>Half-orcs’ grayish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent
                                        teeth,
                                        and towering builds make their orcish heritage plain for all to see.<br>

                                        <br>Half-orcs stand
                                        between 5 and 7 feet tall and usually weigh between 180 and 250 pounds.<br>

                                        <br>Orcs regard battle scars as tokens of pride and ornamental scars as things
                                        of
                                        beauty.<br>

                                        <br>Other scars, though, mark an orc or half-orc as a former slave or a
                                        disgraced exile.<br>

                                        <br>Any half-orc who has lived among or near orcs has scars, whether
                                        they are marks of humiliation or of pride, recounting their past exploits and
                                        injuries.<br>

                                        <br>Such a half-orc living among humans might display these scars proudly or
                                        hide them in shame.<br>
                                    </p>

                                        <br>The one-eyed god Gruumsh created the orcs, and even those orcs who turn away
                                        from
                                        his worship can’t fully escape his influence.<br>

                                        <br>The same is true of half-orcs, though
                                        their human blood moderates the impact of their orcish heritage.<br>

                                        <br>Some half-orcs hear
                                        the whispers of Gruumsh in their dreams, calling them to unleash the rage that
                                        simmers within them.<br>

                                        <br>Others feel Gruumsh’s exultation when they join in melee
                                        combat—and either exult along with him or shiver with fear and loathing.<br>

                                        <br>Half-orcs
                                        are not evil by nature, but evil does lurk within them, whether they embrace it
                                        or
                                        rebel against it.<br>

                                        <br>Beyond the rage of Gruumsh, half-orcs feel emotion powerfully.<br>

                                        <br>Rage doesn’t just
                                        quicken their pulse, it makes their bodies burn.<br>

                                        <br>An insult stings like acid, and
                                        sadness saps their strength.<br>

                                        <br>But they laugh loudly and heartily, and simple bodily
                                        pleasures—feasting, drinking, wrestling, drumming, and wild dancing—fill their
                                        hearts with joy.<br>

                                        <br>They tend to be short-tempered and sometimes sullen, more inclined
                                        to action than contemplation and to fighting than arguing.<br>

                                        <br>The most accomplished
                                        half-orcs are those with enough self-control to get by in a civilized land.<br>

                                                        races, late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves,
                                                        elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they
                                                        strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. 
                                                        Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder races, and that’s why they
                                                        build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade.
                                                        Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the

                                        <br>Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common
                                        races.<br>

                                        <br>They have
                                        widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where
                                        they
                                        have settled.<br>

                                        <br>When they settle, though, they stay: they build cities to last for the
                                        ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries.<br>

                                        <br>An individual human
                                        might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves
                                        traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human’s memory.<br>

                                        <br>They live
                                        fully in the present—making them well suited to the adventuring life—but also
                                        plan
                                        for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy.<br>

                                        <br>Individually and as a group,
                                        humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and
                                        social dynamics.<br>

                                                        struck generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus—overlord of the Nine

                                        <br>Tieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the broadest possible
                                        sense,
                                        they still look human. However, their infernal heritage has left a clear imprint
                                        on
                                        their appearance.<br>

                                        <br>Tieflings have large horns that take any of a variety of shapes:
                                        some have curling horns like a ram, others have straight and tall horns like a
                                        gazelle’s, and some spiral upward like an antelopes’ horns.<br>

                                        <br>They have thick tails,
                                        four to five feet long, which lash or coil around their legs when they get upset
                                        or
                                        nervous.<br>

                                        <br>Their canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid
                                        colors—black, red, white, silver, or gold—with no visible sclera or pupil.<br>

                                        <br>Their
                                        skin tones cover the full range of human coloration, but also include various
                                        shades
                                        of red.<br>

                                        <br>Their hair, cascading down from behind their horns, is usually dark, from
                                        black or brown to dark red, blue, or purple.<br>
                                    </p>

                                        <br>Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or towns,
                                        often
                                        in the roughest quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers,
                                        thieves, or crime lords.<br>

                                        <br>Sometimes they live among other minority populations in
                                        enclaves where they are treated with more respect.<br>

                                        <br>Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own way in
                                        the
                                        world
                                        and that they have to be strong to survive.<br>

                                        <br>They are not quick to trust anyone who
                                        claims to be a friend, but when a tiefling’s companions demonstrate that they
                                        trust
                                        him or her, the tiefling learns to extend the same trust to them.<br>

                                        <br>And once a tiefling gives someone loyalty, the tiefling is a firm friend or
                                        ally
                                        for life.<br>
